>My friend, you suffer from the misplaced optimism of the doomed.

I watched "*Snowpiercer*" a couple of days ago. It is an interesting movie from the artists in South Korea based on a French graphic novel. Before the movie, I had never read the graphic novel. The movie though was intense to say the least. The movies I have watched, coming out of Korea have been remarkable. The first one I watched was 'Oldboy' which was remade by Hollywood and remade badly. All the movies have this intensity about them that is scary. Snowpiercer is a social-commentary, environment-support tirade, science-fiction rollercoaster with oodles of gore, intense scenes with cannibalism being mentioned, infant-killing and dismemberment by freezing are some of the things that end up on the screen.

The movie stuck with me because it was a really well packaged story on how social-strata works and why it always happens with the people. That social commentary was exceptionally well done with the differences between the lower-social class people in the movie and the upper-social class people in the movie illustrated quite strongly. Second thing that stuck with me was the commentary on resource-balance. That was the overarching key-point in the story and it was very well utilized. 

Definitely one of the better movies from 2014 that can be watched. If you are in for some intense movie while enjoying some social commentary, solid acting, top-notch action sequence with an unpredictable plot: Snowpiercer should have you covered.
