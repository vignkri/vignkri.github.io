Yes. It is the beginning of my Masters graduating thesis. My thesis is on analysing the possibility of taking garbage and making electricity and heat using the garbage in a SOFC through a gasifier. And thus, starts my trial in journaling my travels through the mythical lands of thesis work. 

##What is my thesis about? 

Garbage. Turning garbage into electricity. That is what my thesis is about. Waste-incineration-to-energy systems do exist but those are large scale waste-disposal systems that manage to generate a lot of electricity. The project I am working on is at a smaller scale. Imagine a small system at your home where you can throw all the garbage you generate into to burn and convert into electricity through a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). It is my thesis to find out whether it would work and if it worked, how well it would work. All of the work being done, theoretically using a slightly clear mathematical model.

##How am I doing it? 

Planning the thesis has been hard work. Until now, I've been reading quite some papers dedicated to my thesis. That said, all of my thesis work is shared between a couple of applications on my laptop and the desktop in my project desk to manage all of it. 

* **Mendeley Desktop/Web** - It is quite an useful tool. The main of which is its synchronization that assists me in sharing my research reading about all the systems I have at the present. Both my desktop and my laptop. It is painless and a great research tool to find articles and keep them organizes. And finally, it generates the BibTex file with the press of a button. 

* **GitHub and Texmaker with MikTex** - This is a great combination. A proper version control system along with Texmaker hooked up to MikTex is perfect. Much better than Dropbox thanks to the stronger version control system that gives the power to me when to commit and when not to commit. I feel that GitHub is really powerful with systems involving coding (or) lot of text. 

* **OneNote** - I have been torn about Evernote and OneNote but OneNote is a far stronger suite for note-taking and creating outlines thanks to its far more robust text system compared to Evernote. That gives me preference for OneNote in my thesis. Able to create flexible documents and completely randomly structured box-based input systems makes it my favorite tool for putting my thoughts down. And yeah, now it is free!

* **A5 Notebook (Ruled)** - This is my meeting note-taking tool. I keep it well and with me all the time. All the meetings I have with my supervisor goes in this one with a fine-liner. Keeps me up to date and writing always is good since it keeps whatever you write in your memory. 

##How is it going until now and how will it go? 

It has been a decent start but there is a long way to go. I'll try to describe my thoughts and actions over the course of the thesis here. It is going to be a nice little journal chronicling my trip through the timeline of the thesis. Most of my work is going to be right now is concentrating on getting data for my thesis. The focus right now is to get data regarding the garbage composition. Once I get the required data, I'll get right into getting a bit more detailed about the work regarding the thesis especially with the model of the system and getting it right. That would be in a one/two weeks in the maximum. 

I'll keep this as a live series until I finish my thesis. It is my understanding that I am going to have some fun during the course of this thesis and hope to share what I learn here.
