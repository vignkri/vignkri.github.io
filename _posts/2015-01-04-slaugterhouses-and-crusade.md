>And even if wars didn’t keep coming like glaciers, there would still be plain old death. - Slaughterhouse Five

War is insanity? That is the driving force of human development. Over the years, humanity has definitely become efficient in killing. It is not that we humans are durable creatures; in fact, we are quite the opposite: squishy and quite easy to kill. Even if we didn't have a lot of wars happening around us we'd still die. Diseases, accidents, time, food; pretty much everything around us can kill us. There would still be plain old death. That brings me to the source of the quote: Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut. I started reading it near the end of last year, 2014. And I finished it early this year and it was a great book. The writing simple and the story meandering. I read it with my head screwed on tight, cautious in analyzing the various situations that arise in the book. Just like I promised myself how I would read in the resolution for 2015. 

>What we love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time. - Slaughterhouse Five

It is interesting how Kurt Vonnegut structures the book. It has no structure. I am not a literary critique to delve into the intricacies of his writing. Nor am I a great writer myself but time and again, the chaos of the book seemed to link towards the chaos of the war itself. The chaotic structure does not only link the chaos of war itself but also the chaos that engulfs the mind of the person caught in the ward i.e., our protagonist Mr. Billy Pilgrim. 

In my view, the story is as much the slow destruction of a fragile mind such as of the protagonist due to the chaos of war. It is an anti-war propaganda which takes into account the destructive nature of war on people and also puts it into perspective but it goes beyond that. 

>"…All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is. Take it moment by moment, and you will find that we are all, as I’ve said before, bugs in amber.”

This is the second recurring theme. We believe in continuity. Continuity as in that the previous time affects the succeeding time with each from the start to the final. The Trafalmadorians or 'aliens' take that differently and see that each time exists. Each moment exists separately because it exists. I think the right word is 'existentialism'. Each moment is a moment frozen and exists separately from all other moments. In other words, our actions have no effect on the moment succeeding the previous. 

It points to the fact that there is destiny beyond our control. And what has happened has happened and has to be put behind. In one explanatory prose from the 'aliens' they talk about the requirement to focus on the happier moments in one's time rather than the negative moments.  

>“If the accident will.”

When you leave behind the concept of time that takes a lot of precedence, you see these little things. The quote -above- comes quite early in the book. It sums up the existentialism prevalent in the book. Those coincidences in life, summed up as accidences. If the accident will, we would meet again. 

##What did I learn from the book?

Reading through the book and taking quotes out of it, three themes keep recirculating in my mind. The concept of time from human perspective and the perspective of the Trafalmadorians, the chaos of war and how little each human lived weighs in a person's mind when death happens all around you. The latter of the themes enforced time and again by the phrase "**so it goes**". So much so that the phrase becomes satirical and you start smiling becomes it becomes something you are used to so much that it doesn't extend the same horror it deserves. 

For me, the book was a great and interesting read. It was quiet a journey through the book and I love the themes that have been discussed in the book and the simple writing style. My takeaway from the book is to look at each frozen moment in time separately and see what it explains rather than taking time continuously. I'll definitely be revisiting this book later this year to see how my thoughts have held up with regards to the theme. It is a definite read in case you have never read it yet. I'll leave you with one more quote that I really loved from the book.
