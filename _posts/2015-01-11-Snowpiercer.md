>My friend, you suffer from the misplaced optimism of the doomed.

I watched "*Snowpiercer*" a couple of days ago. It is an interesting movie from the artists in South Korea based on a French graphic novel. Before the movie, I had never read the graphic novel. The movies I have watched, coming out of Korea have been remarkable. The first one, 'Oldboy' also remade by Hollywood and remade badly, was intense and had quite a difficult twist at the end. Difficult being difficult to watch. All the movies from the far east have this intensity about them that is scary and quite hard to watch. Snowpiercer is a social-commentary, environment-support tirade, science-fiction rollercoaster with oodles of gore and intense scenes. It doesn't chew less by showing dismemberment by freezing, mentions of cannibalism and the taste of humans. It aims to shock but within realism of the whole setting. 

>You've seen what people so without leadership. They devour one another.

The movie stuck with me because it was a really well packaged story on how social-strata works and why it social strata naturally or forced social strata arrives in a group of people. Beyond that, it took the semblance of conspiracy to why social strata stays in its position. A quite an interesting view to say the least. Second thing that stuck with me was the commentary on resource-balance. That was the overarching thread in the story and it was very well utilized. It also was the great thread tying everything together. 

Definitely one of the better movies from 2014 that can be watched and should be watched. If you are in for an intense movie: Snowpiercer should have you covered.
