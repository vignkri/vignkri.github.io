Onions. They are a slightly irritating vegetable. In fact, they are more than slightly irritating when you are preparing them to make a delicious meal. Well, it starts right when you cut them. Vegetables are rarely dangerous except these abominations called onions. You may be the burliest and the most stoic of men. Yet, onions would wear you down and make you as human as you can be. 

##The Secret of the Onions

Well, if we are to get into the chemistry of the onion, there exists in the vegetable an irritant. Enzymes, called Alliinases, start to break down the sulfoxides present in the cellular structure of the onion as soon as the knife starts its violence. These enzymes release sulfenic acids that get reacted on, producing a volatile gas; The source of your crying. The volatile gas quickly vaporize and start roving around looking for the offending eye. As it enters the eye, it acts very similar to that of any irritant: makes you cry. And with a wonderful immune response built in, our body knows to expel the irritant by copiously overflowing the eye with tears. This has been tried and tested by evolution for thousands of years starting with a broken heart ending at a broken onion.  

But it didn't stop with that. Onions, so violently powerful against men was wielded as a weapon centuries ago. They say that most of the scientific discoveries begin with war. And war furthers what we can weaponize and what we can achieve. We did this with onions as well. Onions were our first biological weapon.

##Early onion-weapons

So, little amounts of onions can make you weep more than Leonardo DiCaprio made you in Titanic. However, knowing humans, we weaponized onions. The first biological weapon is definitely the onion used by wives and scorned lovers against the idiotic man. A simple phrase such as *cut an onion* could make a man cry. What else would you do, if you needed food? Cut the damned onions and cry like a baby. Making a fool of yourself. This was in the early centuries when man discovered the potential onions offered for cuisine. But, women, in their wisdom knew from the first that onions were destined for greatness when they asked men to cut them down for food. This was just the start of the violent and bloody history behind the onion which has been controversially hidden from the public eye.

##Early AD

For the foodie in us, onions provide a great taste and add a great deal of flavour to the food. On a completely different track, onions added another avenue of use for magicians and villains all around the world. There are written documents from early Chinese dynasties on the capabilities of onion vapours in breakable vials as weapons. Perhaps, these were the earliest designs of tear gas. But the most ingenious of usages was by a 3rd century wandering monk and magician whose name is not known. In a book, titled 'Bardus hoc, enim credunt', translated later in the 4th-to-5th century, he is said to have used it to bamboozle early Pagan tribes by making a monster of a man, unseen previously by those tribes, cry like a baby. Stunning populace everywhere in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, this man's understandably amazing use of onions were just the beginning. As time crossed the black plague era, onion's usage as a weapon diminished thanks to other problems that the society was facing. But then it came back again as a force in the early 18th and 19th century leading to one of the greatest and horrendous scientific achievements in times of war.

##The War era

During the time when it was not used as a biological weapon, onion's fame as a remarkable ingredient grew. This did not however keep blood-thirsty men from finding out its bloody trail in history. Unfortunately, side-by-side, the use of onions in war grew. Again. Started, at the end of the 16th century, were the incredible research on onion based compounds that would later be used as a foundation for savage chemicals in the first and second world war. Chlorine gas and the other weaponized gases were offshoots of the research trying to weaponize onion-based products. Dr. Krual Masakre, first pioneered this research, a French born, german scientist, he was prolific in creating the first onion pellets that when fired against men vaporized; instantaneously clouding people in the stink of onions. Once the gas came into contact with the human eye, blindness followed the whooping, throat-burning cough that the man would be persecuted with first.  

Stemming from these cruel and downright evil objects of destruction, more such weapons were developed; the same weapons that would become chlorine gas in the early 20th century at the first world war. Later on, more concrete forms of tear gases and other savage projectiles would be crafted and utilized for numbing destruction based on synthetic chemical. More powerful and destructive than the layered-vegetable, the spotlight on the onion slowly diminished. Now, its prowess in the culinary sciences sheds more spotlight on it than its bloody rings in histroy. But, ladies and gentlemen, now you know where all of these demonic inventions came to be in the first place. It started with a broken heart of a man cutting onions. Onions. Remember this evil vegetable. Now, you know why you have to cut it every time. It is evil, it needs to be eaten away. Tortured by the mouths of men and the incredibly acidic bowels. Now you know what to do: Eat onions. Save the world.

####Note: THIS IS A JOKE. A VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT JOKE, PERHAPS?
