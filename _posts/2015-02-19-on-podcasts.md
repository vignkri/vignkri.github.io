Podcasts are awesome to listen to. They are fun, depending on the one you listen to. They are informative, depending on the one you listen to. And they are a great way to learn something new. My consumption of podcasts started in late 2013 when I moved to Denmark and started biking the 10 kilometers from my dorm to my university. So, over the last one year, I have tried, tested, removed, added and removed, added once more, many a number of podcasts. Some podcasts have stuck while many others have just been not as good as the ones I am now listening to and therefore no longer are on my list. 

##My Current Podcast List

Here, I'm compiling a list of podcasts I listen to regularly. At the end, I'll end up with the Podcast manager of my choice. 

* [**The Bugle**](http://thebuglepodcast.com): This is one of the funniest podcasts around. Satire. I have become a lover of satire ever since I started listening to these British badasses. John Oliver who now runs a TV show in the USA called 'The Late Night Show with John Oliver' and has become quite a celebrity with his viral videos is amazing in this podcast. So is Andy Zaltzman, a cricket-loving, satirical monster and the king-of-nonsense if I may say so. This is an amazing podcast just because of their funny take on world news. Definitely great if you are a fan of satirical comedy. 

* [**Dan Carlin's Hardcore History**](http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/): From funny, we go to serious. Hardcore history is amazing indeed. Thanks to Dan Carlin's amazing delivery and great analysis of military history. The podcast tries to cover everything in detail; at least tries to fill in as much as possible. If you have to start somewhere, start with the series on Genghis Khan - The Wrath of Khans. You'll not stop listening. 

* [**StartUp**](http://gimletmedia.com/show/startup/): I work at an entrepreneurial organization and this just fits in with my daily staple of entrepreneurship. This is the story of Gimlet Media as it started out. Brilliant little show based on recordings of one-man's struggle as he tries to start up. You'll cringe. You'll smile. You'll definitely learn throughout the show. Definitely a golden one on startups and the life of a tech entrepreneur. Great show.

* [**Intelligence Squared**](http://www.intelligencesquared.com/podcast/): This is a serious one again. It is a series of debates and discussions on topics that are affect the world. The version I listen to is the UK version however a US based version is also available. I don't listen to all shows in this. Instead, I pick based on the show notes. Some of the shows are really awesome and I definitely recommend if you want to learn what great thinkers have to say about some of the things that goes around us in this world. 

* [**Manchester United RantCast**](http://www.unitedrant.co.uk/category/rant-cast/): Okay, this is probably the odd one out of the pack but if you are a good reader, you'd have noticed that I am a Red Devils fan. Thus, this definitely does fit in properly with my hobbies and likes. Definitely a great show that takes apart how Manchester United play week in week out. For the football fan in me, I love it because it keeps me connected with the amazing team I love: Manchester United. 

* [**You Are Not So Smart**](http://youarenotsosmart.com/): This is a different show about cupcakes and scienc-y and thought provoking ideas.  The topics are usually on neuro-psychology and it is extremely interesting listening to. Especially if you want to know how decisions are made, how the environment affects us in a simplified and engaging way. I listen to it more often, right now, because the show even though on many levels is quite dry, the research the podcast delves into is top notch. 

##Podcast Manager

The podcast manager I use is called 'Pocketcasts' by a developer called ShiftyJelly. It is available on the web, android and iOS for a fee which is remarkably small for the quality of the application. I love the design, the ease of use and of course the support you get from the developers. Check them out here depending on what your preferred technological tool is: 
[web](https://play.pocketcasts.com/web),
[android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts),
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4We).

**Podcasts that are completely new on my playlist:** The Energy Collective, Reply All, Here Be Monsters, 

**Podcasts that have been on the list and I no longer listen to:** This Week in Startups with Jason Calacanis, Theory of Everything, Radiolab from WNYC, Freakonomics Radio, 99% Invisible, On Being, The Moth Podcast, The Art of Manliness
