It is the end of month 2 of my thesis. Over the last month and three-quarters, I have become much more aware of my thesis and its requirements. Not that I was not aware at the first. Instead, the vision of my thesis has gotten cleared as time has ticked onward.

On getting things done, I've successfully arrived at the thesis template on LaTeX. The whole process took far less time than what I imagined it would take. Time also was quite easy on getting the skeleton drafts of the first couple of chapters of the thesis. But before I go on a complete update let me talk about my thesis. 

##What is it about?

Gasification. It is a pretty complex technology but in the simplest of terms, the aim is to produce a gas which can act as a fuel for various energy-generating processes. The production of this 'synthetic-gas' depends on the fuel that undergoes drying, pyrolyzation, partially oxidization and then reduction in a 'gasifier'. Fuels that are sent through this gasifier are wood, coal, natural gas and even waste. These are called feedstock. 

The research I am conducting is on household waste gasification. Aim of my work is to look into the feasibility of a small-scale system that could fit into a household where it would gasify the waste produced and send the gas through an SOFC to produce electricity and heat for the household. Question right now is not whether it would be - beautifully designed, easy-to-use or will it have a compact size. 

##Questions to answer

The first question that would be answered is 'is it possible?'. It is important to see the source of the fuel as a heterogeneous mixture of things that differ seasonally and differ from house to house as well. This makes the use of waste a complicated procedure. However, the presence of source separation as seen in most of the high-income countries would alleviate some of the issues with this. 

Second question is the matter of gas composition. There are multiple reasons for this question. Firstly, the fuel is pretty much combusted and the release of certain chemical compounds is inevitable as they react to the high temperatures of the gasifier. These could be for example highly toxic compounds thanks to plastics present in the waste. Second issue is that the SOFC requires a very clean gas and this pretty much negates presence of impurities in the 'syn-gas'. It is, therefore, imperative that the gas composition is as clearly modeled as possible to make sure cleaning technologies can be implemented. 

The third question would be the actual power produced. This is the overarching question for the research. How much of the energy would be actually consumed by the system itself. Followed by the energy that will be available for utilization after the consumption by the system. These are the three important questions my thesis will look towards answering. 

##What I already know

From all the reading that I have done on the subject of waste and waste composition, emissions and gasification itself, I've gleaned some information. 

* The process is highly dependent on the energy content of the fuel i.e., waste. Calorific value of waste and waste components would pretty much control the energy available in the syngas at the end. 

* Identification of the energy content would be hard since garbage is an ever-changing variable. It changes according to time of the year, the family and their usage habits. 

* There is not a lot known about small scale gasification systems but there is a minimum size of gasification systems that has to be considered. Anything below this threshold would be useless. However, to achieve this threshold the garbage quantity and the energy content has to match up. 

* The question of discontinuous operation is up in the air. Right now, most of the advanced gasification systems that are being tested utilize a continuous system. Ergo, feedstock is continuously fed into the system and the whole system works continuously. For a household system, that flow of garbage is ridiculous to even assume and, therefore, the question of discontinuous operation has to be answered.

* Chemical composition of the gas is another curve-ball. Waste outputs change and this changes the potential gas compositions as well. Nailing an approximate list of chemicals that are emitted requires my attention. This is at the top of my list as it also is required to nail down the cleaning subsystem.

##What is coming up on my thesis plan

The first thing that is on my list is to take a few bags of garbage and head to test the composition of the waste when combusted. That is on the top of my list and the requirement has already been scheduled soon. Along with that, I have a few drafts that need to be updated which is the focus of my work for the next few days.

Finally, the theoretical model is on the list that has to be built utilizing the in-house tool called DNA. The requirement is to build the model and add the extra chemical compounds not added in the DNA repository for the final model. I hope to get going with the test on the garbage bags soon and probably have exciting information from it that would further my thesis along its path.

####Post-script
In regards with the thesis, I have one more post alongside this that I would like to share with the world regarding waste and what I've learnt about. That is currently in the draft stage and I hope to send it out into the wild soon enough.
