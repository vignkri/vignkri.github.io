It has been quite an intense 5 months with the thesis and the other stuff that went on parallel to the thesis. I've been quite vocal about what my thesis is about. I really expected to carry on with writing more about my thesis and the work in it as I finished various parts of it. Hopes of that were quickly dashed due to the increased workload that faced me and enveloped me in the final two and half months. The intensity required to keep it up made sure that I spent as little time as possible in writing here. 

With the thesis now over and the summer dawning ever so brilliantly, I hope to write more in the coming months. Write more and write well so that it fills up the pages that have been missing in the last couple of months. Stay tuned here. I'll definitely be writing more.
