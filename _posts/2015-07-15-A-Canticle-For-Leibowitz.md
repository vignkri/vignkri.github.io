A Canticle For Leibowitz by Walter M. Miller Jr., released in 1960, is a post-apocalyptic science fiction novel that deals with the themes of historic recurrence and religion in a dystopian society. It is a very well written book and captivating in the way the plot unfolds. Viewing the whole society from the constrained view of a missionary devoted to protect artifacts of science from before the apocalypse, the glimpses of the society changed and wounded by the event is quite interesting and the whole universe is beautifully described. It is a definite read, and a classic book, if you are just there for the story and it is even more interesting if you are interested in theology which the book revolves around.
