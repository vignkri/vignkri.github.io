Everyone is allowed to do multiple stupid things in their life. Some get awarded with the Darwin award when they reject everything that stares in their face showing complete and utter humiliation and yet, and yet, go ahead and do the stupidest thing ever. Well, on Saturday, 31st of October, that was me. A wonderful halloween. 

When someone calls you 'a chicken', you have to admit it because they are in their infinite wisdom, absolutely correct. There is nothing to be gained from admitting that you have limits. Everybody has limits. My limit, as I found out, was at the combination of three potent chilli peppers: Habanero, the bhut jolakia and the red scorpion drizzled over buns, patties and lettuce. In other words: a nuclear bomb of a burger.

31st of October, I did the challenge to eat that burger. To be frank, I don't regret it at all. It taught me something important: when you have to sign a contract that pushes all the risks onto you, RUN!
