I probably need a Darwin award for stupidity and pride. 31st of October, 2015 will probably live on in infamy for me since I understood a very important lesson on this day/date.

> When someone gives you a contract to sign that what you eat will probably kill you and you can't sue us: you don't eat there.

There is nothing to be gained from admitting that you have limits and some times, everybody becomes stupid. My limit and my stupidity, as I found out, was at the combination of three potent chilli peppers: Habanero, the bhut jolakia and the red scorpion drizzled over buns, patties and lettuce. In other words: a nuclear bomb of a burger.

31st of October, I did the challenge to eat that burger. To be frank, I don't regret it at all. It taught me something important: when you have to sign a contract to eat something that pushes all the risks onto you, RUN!
