##Who is the writer?

I go by the name Vignesh Krishnamoorthy, a student of Masters in Sustainable Energy Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen.

##What do I write about?
I write about things that I have a view on. It may be something I got me thinking profoundly. That would range from books, movies, music, to my current master thesis and so on. In total, I will only be writing about the things that leave me thinking when I finish doing that something. 

##What is my posting schedule? 
All the posts would come live on a Sunday, CET or GMT +1:00 for easier understanding. These posts won't appear every sunday. Rather, they will only happen when I come across or write something that I really want to have it join the voice of the internet. Unless otherwise, there will be silence.
