I go by the name Vignesh Krishnamoorthy. Born and raised in India, I have lived there for 21 years before I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to study my Masters in Sustainable Energy at the Technical University of Denmark in August, 2013. Currently, I live in Denmark and study in Denmark with 6 months to go on my programme. My main interests lie in Thermodynamics and Advanced Power Plants in my field of study. That is not even restricted as they also extend towards Data Analytics and currently I am enthusiastic about Quantified-Self. Apart from all of that, I breathe Manchester United; I run a weekly radio-show at DTU through which I share my love for music and finally I am a budding entrepreneur and a writer. All of what I do is what defines me. 

#What am I writing about? 

I write about a rather large amount stuff but I wanted to remove my dependence on third party systems that I have no control over and this is my trial run with something 'hack-y' as github. I am not an experimental person but the last few weeks, my inclination to stop being curious and start doing stuff have hit the higher number and this is my trial with experimenting with all that. The list of things I plan to write about here include:

* my blog posts - covering my brain-farts, brain-diarrhea
* movies
* music
* quantified-self data thoughts
* games
* stories
* travelogues
* My hardships during my Master-Thesis
* Living in a foreign country
* And possibly more...
