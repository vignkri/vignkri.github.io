##Who is the writer?

I go by the name Vignesh Krishnamoorthy, a student of Masters in Sustainable Energy Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen.

##What do I write about?
I write about things that I have a view on. It may be something I got me thinking profoundly. That would range from books, movies, music, to my current master thesis and so on. In total, I will only be writing about the things that leave me thinking when I finish doing that something.

##What is my posting schedule?
All the posts would come live on a Sunday, CET or GMT +1:00 for easier understanding. These posts won't appear every sunday. Rather, they will only happen when I come across or write something that I really want to have it join the voice of the internet. Unless otherwise, there will be silence.

####What made you start your blog?

Writing has always been a passion. I used to write short stories but that was short-lived. Now, I really want to practice writing. Not only did I want to write short stories but I also wanted to establish a blog post where I can write about the thoughts I have. Those are pretty much the reason why I started writing on my blog.

####If you would choose a special talent what would it be?

I have a smidge of humour. But my superpower would have to be the ability to make people laugh instantaneously. Making people laugh is hard and doing that is an extremely rewarding experience.

####What is your favorite dish and what country does it come from?

Food. I love food. My favorite dish though has been only one forever: Dosa from my beautiful country, India. It is simple. It is heavenly. It is spectacularly awesome. Always my favorite.

####Coffee or Tea?

Tea. I absolutely hate coffee.

####Your best clothes are?

I have the sense of fashion of a frog. My favorites are jeans and a t-shirt. So, I have no clear idea what my best clothes are.

####If you were stranded on an isolated island you would take?

I would take a swimming lesson. If you threw me right now into any body of water, I will sink like a stone. There is no way I can swim right now. Ergo, with swimming lessons, I will probably have much better chance of living than without one.

####Do you prefer night or day? Why?

I prefer neither. Sometimes I love the night for the darkness and solace it brings and in some other times I prefer the day. No reason why. It is completely random that I like both.

####What is your favorite music genre?

Instrumentals. My listening list consists mainly of an Indian band called Indian Ocean followed by Explosions In the Sky and a lot of jazz. Pretty much instrumental music has taken over my listening library. Definitely instrumentals.

####What is your next travel destination?

Right now, it is India. But my real and hopeful travel destination is to get myself to Iceland with friends for 2 weeks of roadtripping and camping. Summer of 2016 is the most possible as it looks right now.

####One sentence that describes you.

Super opinionated with a humor to boot but lazy as a snail and a bit of smartness to cover up the laziness.
