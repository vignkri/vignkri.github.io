It is the beginning of my Masters graduating thesis. My thesis is on analysing the possibility of taking garbage and making electricity and heat using the garbage using a SOFC through a gasifier. Let me try to explain what my thesis is about in some detail.

##What is my thesis about? 

Garbage. Turning garbage into electricity would be the succinct way of describing my thesis. Waste-incineration-to-energy systems do exist but only as large scale waste-disposal systems that manage to generate a lot of electricity. The project I am working on is at a smaller scale. Imagine a small system at your home where you can throw all the garbage you generate in order to burn and convert into electricity. It is my thesis to find out whether it would work and if it worked, how well it would work.

##How am I doing it? 

Planning the thesis has been hard work. Until now, I've been reading quite some papers dedicated to my thesis. That said, all of my thesis work is shared between a couple of applications on my laptop and the desktop in my project desk to manage all of it. 

* **Mendeley Desktop/Web** - It is quite an useful tool. The main of which is its synchronization that assists me in sharing my research reading about all the systems I have at the present. Both my desktop and my laptop. It is painless and a great research tool to find articles and keep them organizes. And finally, it generates the BibTex file with the press of a button. 

* **GitHub and Texmaker with MikTex** - This is a great combination. A proper version control system along with Texmaker hooked up to MikTex is perfect. Much better than Dropbox thanks to the stronger version control system that gives the power to me when to commit and when not to commit. I feel that GitHub is really powerful with systems involving coding (or) lot of text. 

* **OneNote** - I have been torn about Evernote and OneNote but OneNote is a far stronger suite for note-taking and creating outlines thanks to the stronger text system compared to Evernote. And yeah, it is now free!

* **A5 Notebook (Ruled)** - This is my meeting note-taking tool. I keep it well and with me all the time. All the meetings I have with my supervisor goes in this one with a fine-liner. Keeps me up to date and writing always is good since it keeps whatever you write with your hands in your memory.

##How is it going until now and how will it go? 

It has been a decent start but there is a long way to go. I'll try to describe my thoughts and actions over the course of the thesis here. This would be a series of posts chronicling my trip on the river of my thesis. I don't know where I am going except that I have a faint idea of what would be waiting for me. So, it just feels prudent to put my experiences with my thesis up here in order to have a written record.
