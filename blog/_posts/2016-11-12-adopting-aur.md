I had an interesting event couple of weeks back. A package I work regularly with, at work and home, was orphaned on the Arch-Linux Community package repository. I came to find this out when out of the blue, this one package recurred on my Yaourt install list. That made me curious.

The curiosity led me to understand that the package was orphaned. That is that no developer or user wanted to control and update the package going forward. So, I had a thought: why don't I adopt the package? I was more scared mixed with excitement than anything adopting the package. So, I sat down and wrote down the reasons I found myself scared:

- I am a beginner in Linux and in the world of Arch linux probably way smaller than a beginner. This was the first fear. The fear of not being able to hold the package up and running.
- A lot of people are probably using the package and I definitely would have to make sure my package works every time there is an update. I have to keep it updated with the github repository.

The two reasons sounded and looked quite scary as I made my user profile and made up the required credentials to adopt the package. And two weeks after now, I feel great that I have a package I take care of in AUR. Somehow, two weeks after that thought, I feel really happy to have a slight distraction that can help me critically evaluate and update my code to make sure the package is well-maintained. I am learning a tonne of new things that I don't think would've learnt so quickly before. It was a leap of faith but now I'm happy that I did it.
