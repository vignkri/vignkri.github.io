<h1>Hi, this is `Vignesh Krishnamoorthy`</h1>

I graduated from the Technical University of Denmark as a Sustainable Energy Engineer, in 2015. Currently, I am employed at <a href="http://leapcraft.dk">Leapcraft</a> creating data products. 

In my free time, I tinker with programming, read, watch and write about various things that pique my interest. You can read about what I think and what I do, right here. Check out the <a href='blog'>blog</a> to see more of what I write. You can contact me through <a href="http://github.com/vignkri">Github</a>, through <a href='https://dk.linkedin.com/in/vigneshkrishnamoorthy'>LinkedIn</a> or by sending me a mail <a href='mailto:k.vignesh.krish@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20!'>here</a>.
