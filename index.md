Sustainable Energy Engineer who graduated from the Technical University of Denmark, DTU in the summer of 2015. Currently, I am employed at <a href="http://leapcraft.dk">Leapcraft</a> creating data products for smart cities.

In my free time, I tinker with programming, read a lot, watch a lot of movies/tv-shows and write about a variety of things that I currently am interested in. This is an extension of all of those things I do. Besides all of the things done with a roof over my head, I love running and cycling which takes up some interesting amount of time in my life. You can read what I write by going to my [blog]({{ site.url }}/blog/) and if you like the design of the blog, feel free to fork it.
