<h1>I am Vignesh Krishnamoorthy</h1>
Sustainable Energy engineer graduating from Technical University of Denmark, in 2015. I currently work with <a href="http://leapcraft.dk">Leapcraft</a> in creating data products. In my free time, I tinker with programming, electronics and a lot of writing. My pet projects concern energy optimization, thermodynamic modelling, and energy markets in Python. As for writing, I maintain a personal blog where I write about everything from personal thoughts, updates on projects to travel information and short stories.
