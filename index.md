My name is Vignesh Krishnamoorthy, a masters graduate in Sustainable Energy, Thermal Energy from the Technical University of Denmark. I was born in Trivandrum, Kerala, India and grew up in the beautiful city of Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India where I did my school. After my school, I had my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at Kalasalingam University where I had a lot of fun for 4 years travelling to and from the university by bus about 60 kilometers away. After finishing up my bachelors, I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark to do my Masters in Sustainable Energy with specialization in Thermal Energy.

This blog is a chronicle of my thoughts, and some projects I work on and off in my free time. As an extension of my desire to get better with the written word, I write about a lot of things. Currently, I am interning at Leapcraft, where I work on an engineering and data science role. You can contact me at: k
