Born in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala in India and named Vignesh, just for having a name that started with the same letter as my sister, I grew up in a larger city about 400 kilometers away: Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India. I finished my high school studying Computer Science, Physics, Chemistry and Math before joining a Mechanical Engineering program at Kalasalingam University for my bachelors. After finishing my Bachelor's project on fluid flow through T-junctions using OpenFoam, I moved to Lyngby, Denmark in 2013 to pursue my Masters in Sustainable Engineering. Taking on a study line on *Thermal energy*, I graduated in the fall of 2015 with a thesis on the gasification process using household waste materials. After graduation, I joined as an intern for 3 months at Leapcraft ApS in Copenhagen and now am a full-time employee at the company. 

As an avid reader, I try to write a lot and as much as I read. Music is a passion that I identify a lot. In my free time, I try to write, listen to music and podcasts, watch movies and sometimes tv-series and most other times, read. Welcome to my blog. I have been trying to rebuild the blog to handle both my professional interests and personal interests. I hope you find what I write, interesting. You can contact me through email or on LinkedIn.
