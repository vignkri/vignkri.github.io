Born in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala and named Vignesh, just for having a name starting with the same letter as my sister, I grew up about 400 kilometers away at a city/town called Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Finishing my high school with Computer Science, Physics and Chemistry and then a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering at Kalasalingam University, I moved to Denmark in 2013 to pursue my Masters. I completed my masters in *Sustainable Engineering - Thermal Energy* study line in July, 2015. After graduation, I joined as an intern and now a full time employee at Leapcraft ApS. 

This is the landing page of sorts for my thoughts, hallucinations, book reviews and sometimes technical treatises on topics I'm interested in and I am working on. Apart from all of this, this page serves a purpose to consolidate most of online presence into one. welcome, if you have any questions, find me on Github/Twitter/Facebook. You can find my contact information with a bit of work. Cheers and enjoy your stay.
