Connected  
Old and personal  
Time flowing like liquid  
Linking luxury  
In gold and marbles  
With depression  
In black bricks and Iron bars.  
  
Stone-pavements  
Sleep with concrete  
Confluence of sweat and time  
Pitted by rifles and canons  
Laid by hands and machines  
Smoothened by feet and tires.  
  
To walk  
A treasure to find  
Hidden among roads and streets  
Sheathed by the shadow of hrad  
Upon his horse  
Looking at towers and smoke  
At a land  
Changed by industry and spirit  
Broken at wars  
Split by ideals.  
  
On walls  
On doors  
On windows  
Rest art from people past  
Leaving to find  
A treasure of character  
Of people lived and living.
