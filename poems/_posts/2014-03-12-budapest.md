Torrid, turbulent  
On the banks of duna  
Split like serpents tongue  
By past  
By concepts of men  
Rest the cities two  
Pest and Buda.  
United in past  
Through love lost  
Blood shed  
Lives lost  
Amongst the rushing  
Duna they stand.  
  
Beside facades  
Built by hands  
Through artistry disparate  
On sleeping stone  
Pavements; you walk  
The distant rumble  
Of trams and vehicles  
A Nocturne in the tangerine  
Radiance of lights.  
  
Squares and grids  
The city built on banks  
Opposite castles and fortresses  
Old town contrasting new  
Bridges spanning Duna  
Connecting the contrasts  
A bridge across time  
A bridge across personalities.  
  
Stand there in the pier  
Look over the other side  
City lit by a dim glow  
The rumbling music of trams  
Crisp and cold  
The wind hits your naked skin  
Whispering a song  
Written over time  
With screams of passion  
With screams of hatred  
A song of love  
A song of beauty  
A song of change.
