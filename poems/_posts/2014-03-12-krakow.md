Snow gently falling  
On walls erected with blood  
Roads littered with snow  
Melting and crumbling  
Cold piercing  
Like needle through   
Threaded sheets of cotton.  
  
Beautiful in its splendor  
Terrible in its history  
Lost amongst its many roads  
Runs the failure  
Failure to accept  
The sanctity of our lives.  
  
Chairs rest empty  
Buildings rot from neglect  
In the failing light of the day  
Stand they do in silence  
Awaiting their once masters  
Awaiting their warm embrace  
Awaiting forever  
In the silence  
In the silence that follows death.
