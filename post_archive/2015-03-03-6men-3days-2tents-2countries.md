This is a series of posts from my old blog on a small bicycling road trip that took us from Copenhagen northwards towards Helsingør before crossing over to Sweden and then the trip southward towards Copenhagen. It was 3 days of immense fun and crazy events. I wrote this is as a series in my previous blog which was hosted in Wordpress. Here, I've put it together in a stitched form by copy pasting each of the parts together. It is not a perfect stitch but it should be readable. I'll update it when I have some extra time. Enjoy the read.

##Part 1 - The Beginning

I started to love biking when I came to Denmark. Even though I had biked for 6 years to my school back home in India, it felt different here. Maybe it is because of the weather. It is much more temperate during the summer, making cycling a bliss. Definitely not in the winter though.

The autumn break is a week-long break in studies. My friend and I had pretty much decided that we would be going on a bike tour along two countries - Denmark and Sweden. The trip was planned to have us visit 4 cities - Copenhagen, Helsingør, Helsingborg and Malmo. We had a route planned on Google Maps; a Facebook group of people interested in it. As the break came closer, people started dropping out and number started falling. At the weekend leading up to the break, there were 6 of us interested in it.

You know we are a bit crazy when we spend the weekend before the trip, scheduled Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, on parties, resting and doing a bit of school work instead of planning for the trip. On the Sunday, questions started trickling out: how are we doing it? What are we doing to sleep? What is the food situation? Do we need tents and sleeping bags? First aid kits? Winter jacket?

To the normal, you would probably pull out when you hear these questions on the eve of a bike trip for 3 days along the coast. This is the time of the year when the weather is fickle (in Denmark, its fickle most of the time). Not actually good signs. We decided Monday afternoon that the trip was a 'go' and we hunted down the best deals for tents and sleeping bags. We were scheduled to start at 6:30 from Building 101 at DTU. Sleep came blissfully and I woke up early to take my last shower for 3 days, to eat and get to DTU with 2 of the buddies who were joining me on the trip.

You know there is a problem when all of the members gather and the first thing they ask is: How do we get to Helsingør? We did not have a map with us or a rough route. What we did have was one guy carrying his phone as his navigational compass and the blind thought that going north would lead us to Helsingør. 

That is what we did, we biked through the deer-park near DTU with a phone pointing us the way. It is always that when disaster strikes, it strikes in multiples of 2. Before we reached Helsingør, we had 4 punctures on the same bike every couple of miles. At the near end of the ride to Helsingør, we had to put him on a bus with his bike and get him there while we cycled to the city. We had our lunch; we visited the famed Hamlet's Castle; we took a couple of pictures; we watched the ferry go to Helsingborg somewhere we would also be going.

It was 17:00 when we took the ferry. We jumped on the ferry, said goodbye to two of the other friends who had accompanied us to Helsingør but were going back. The 6 of us paid the price to enter the ferry. We got in, parked the bike and went up to soak the cold air and moisture. What we didn't realize that we did not have a place to sleep for the night (we were discussing it but were not sure), not an idea for food except going to a supermarket and finally no clue as to where we were heading and how.

##Part 2 - Landfall in Swedish Soil


When we got down at Helsingborg, we had a rush through our brain. Adrenaline. It feels good. We had cut off Denmark and we were in Sweden and the trip had just started. All of us got on our respective bikes and pushed off of the ferry leaving it in our wake and not turning back. We were definitely not the brightest and we got lost in the ferry port thanks to not noticing where we went. We circled around for a bit and found the way out. When you have decided to move forward, something tries to stop you. This time it was a policeman. He stopped us for we might have looked homeless, jobless and pretty happy to be in Sweden. I don't think they like that kind of stuff. Anyways, we confirmed to him that we were harmless and we were just passing through. We went forward.

The first problem we faced was the complete lack of road signs showing us where the bike paths were. We were as confused as headless pigeons. We saw a person taking a left and followed him/her when an old gentleman in his electric scooter called out to us, 

> 'WRONG WAY, fellas!'

We sniggered amongst ourselves and turned back into another way and were aimlessly flitting around. Our priorities were straight: Food, Beach, Shelter, Fire in that particular order. So, we asked around and identified a supermarket where we can buy something. We found the one pretty close by. Since we were 6 people, 2 of us went in search for beers, another guy and me stood in the cold guarding our home and bed while other 2 went in for shopping. When you are biking, the cold seems not so cold. Your muscles are working and things are swell. When you are standing there with your hands in your pants; the cold starts to hit you. That was what was happening. To make things worse, the sun was setting removing the light that makes you happy and finally we were still on the first part of our priority list. It took us a better part of a hour to buy everything when the guys who went in search of alcohol said that Swedes can't buy alcohol after 18:00. There was an unanimous groan amongst us. After the one hour of searching and figuring out what we needed to buy which included: pasta, lots of meat and some other stuff; we decided we need to get out of the city and find ourselves a shelter for the night.

The direction we moved in was splendid. Again, we knew that we needed to follow the coast, so we pointed the general direction of the coast and biked out of Helsingborg. Following signs that said beach and a camping site. It took us a better part of an hour to figure out that the we don't have any place to stay within the city. We were definitely a bit exhausted and the inability to find a good place to pitch our tents was frustrating to say the least. Finally, after a lucky right turn, we were able to find a huge piece of beach with a camping hostel nearby. Since it was the turn of the fall, everything was closed. Yet, we were pretty sure that we were going to pitch the tent near a barbecue place. That is what we did.

##Part 3 - Pitching Tents and Salvage Operation

We pitched our tents near the grill place, a couple of metres from the beautiful and cold sea. We set up the two tents and decided to have dinner. Being the stubborn and spontaneous group of men we were, we decided that we needed a fire. The question we had was 'how'. Since we were biking, we only had our bags and some food. The eventuality of making a fire had escaped our thoughts when we planned the trip. We were either extremely courageous or extremely naïve or extremely stupid. I guess we were all of that. 

Looking at the grill place, and the need for the fire, we decided we needed some fuel.   Basically anything that would burn was going into the fire place. One of us and I decided to scavenge the weed/wood filled part of the beach and get the necessary stuff while 2 others went out of the beach in search of some grill-lighter-fluid or wood. What we got from the reed filled part was reeds and some wood. After 20 minutes of lighting and re-lighting the weeds we came to the decision that reeds are bad. They don't burn at a high enough temperature to get the fire going. The guys who went out of the beach were far luckier. They had chanced upon a construction site and a huge wooden pallet resting on the pavement. Considering our need, they borrowed the pallet and returned. It was glorious to see them biking with a pallet in their hand to the grill place. Once they came, we laughed and joked about it before turning it into a stomp session to break the pallet into pieces. The pieces promptly went into the grill. Another half hour-forty five minutes later, the fire was roaring. The warmth, relief and comfort was substantial and blissful.

What followed was a feast. We opened almost all of the food we had, showered it onto the fire and tore through them. It was an epic meal time. The realization of the importance of fire was extremely strong for me. I could feel why our ancestors revered the fire. There was extraordinary comfort in the way orange flames leapt outward and upward radiating warmth. Only that it was not only warmth but also a sort of peace. A couple of hours later, after talking and laughing, we were ensconced in the sleeping bag. The next day was going to be very long and we definitely knew it. 

<hr>

##Part 4 - Cold Restart

The fire had burnt itself out come morning. Our decision the previous night was to be up, pack out bags and be out of the beach by 8 or 8:30. What we did not expect was the cold. By cold, it was really cold. When you are sleeping inside a 3 or 4-man tent in a sleeping bag wearing almost all of your clothes, it is extremely warm. Your body has almost immediately switched off the heating system it has. You are hibernating. The first step outside after you've woken up hits you and it hits you pretty hard. It was mighty cold.

What followed the waking up procedure was a hurried effort in packing the tents away and distributing the loads amongst ourselves thoroughly. Even though the cold did not help us pack quickly, we did quite a good job of making it on time. Once everything was packed and the night's leftover emptied into our stomach, we continued. This time around, we were quite sure of the direction we needed to take. But we were as usual unsure of the road we had to follow. Biking near the ocean and at a brisk pace, we warmed up quite quickly even though the cold still hung in the air like a knife. It was waiting for moments of rest so that it could knife through us like a hot knife through butter. 

The road we followed took us through a small fishing harbour, along the side of a golf course and took us to a highway of sorts heading towards the city/town of Landskrona. Our fellowship were pretty sure that we had to go to Landskrona. Firstly, we needed to visit one of the towns in Sweden and secondly, we needed food and a good rest somewhere warm. When we reached the outskirts of Landskrona, we were welcomed by a huge sign telling us how old the city we were visiting was. We took the time to get down and take a couple of pictures with the amazing sign and waving to the passing cars. Once we were done, we biked into the town of Landskrona. 

A cheap pizzeria caught our eyes and we decided that we need to eat there. Couple of us ate our pizzas while the others ate what they had bought/brought from home. After the food, we decided that we need to get into a café, drink some coffee and use the toilets. After that, we were quite late to get out of the city.  Having decided to do go to Lund before we park out tents, we left the town of Landskrona. It was one of the best small towns we were ever in and the pizza was really good. What we didn't know was that our decision of going to Lund would take us deep into the wilderness of Sweden and get us lost for quite some time. 

<hr>

##Part 5 - Losing Our Way

On the way to Lund. This is probably not the last part of the series but it might as well be since I've expanded 3 days of travels into a 6-part series. Here is the 5th part. 

The route from Landskrona to Lund was probably the most interesting and the most frustrating part of the trip. The reason: we got lost. 

The road from Landskrona to Lund is actually a highway. A 90 km/hr speed-limited highway. When you are biking on the side and a huge truck passes you; you get buffeted by the vehicle barrelling past you. The only thing you could do is a single-file speed biking style switching. The guy in the front peels away to the back and the next guy takes the front. We did it for some time but it was exhausting considering we were already tired. Then we started slowing down and came to the decision that we need to switch roads and find safer ones and figure out a route to Lund. So, we took a detour through some smaller towns and villages. 

The route was quite long. But that is a gross understatement. We followed the route as best as we could but it seemed that we were going everywhere around Lund except towards and to Lund. That was when we decided that we need to figure out how we are making it. We needed that soon. A girl who was used to travelling from the town to the city of Lund by bike had an answer for us: follow the road; the city is just 6 miles. We were wondering what that was: 6 miles = approx. 10 kilometers. It was a momentous occasion that we were only half hour or something away. But… we were not. 

It took us an hour and a half to two hours to reach the city. The reason? It was not 6 miles. It was more like 15-20 kilometers (God knows what in miles). We assumed that she was talking in Nautical Miles because : Viking culture maybe? 

We somehow made it, actually. The first thing we did was that we found a supermarket and decided that we require food. The problem we had was that it was 8 in the evening when we reached the supermarket and we didn't have a place to pitch our tents. What we figured that our potential tent place was at the beach another 10 kilometers (maybe less) and it was dark. Definitely not a good sign. Going through the city to get to the beach was beautiful as the city itself was awesome. But we didn’t really have the time to enjoy the city as we were tired and a bit cranky thanks to a long day. When we found our final parking spot near the sea overlooking the skyline (or something like that) of Malmo. It was a parking spot and that was our final rest stop. 

<hr>

##Part 6 - Spires of Malmo

The parking spot was the final rest stop. It was a beautiful rest stop. On that rest stop, multiple realisations happened. The importance of fire. The importance of sleep. And the importance of good food. When your spirits are running low; it bounces back right up with fire, food and sleep. When we pulled into that parking spot, we saw nothing except the skyline of Malmo and we knew it was the place that we needed to be in. To our benefit, there was a toilet nearby as well. Colour us lucky! 

Some of us unpacked the tents and set them up while 2 of us went in search of wood. They somehow managed to knock on a family's house and ask for wood. That was promptly provided and they came back with proper wood that was cut. We lit a fire with  at the edge of the green grass and gravel that filled the parking lot. It was cold and we were hungry. Once the fire was raring to go, we decided to eat our food. It was a feast of humongous proportions and the warmth from the fire was something like a luxury we had not seen in the last 10 hours. It was wonderful. Once that was done, we promptly started playing with the fire. The fire starter fluid which we had was poured with joy onto the flames. It was captivating (a wee bit dangerous as well) when the flames leapt upwards, dancing in the joy of being fed. When all of that was done, we retired into our tents for another sleepy night. 

There was a slight patter on the walls of the tent in the morning. I snuggled my sleeping bag a bit and woke up with a start when my unconscious mind realised what the patter was: rain. Rain. Our nightmare fuel. Our enemy. Our nemesis. He was pouring down onto the ground like an alcoholic would pour wine onto his glass; with joyous abandon. I peeked out of the flap of the tent at the skyline of Malmo which was visible from the night before. It was barely visible between the streams of rain and the cloudiness that seemed to have enveloped the whole region. It was not a good start to the day. 

From that point, the rain was pouring down, we were biking to Malmo after doing a real quick packing. The problems increased. One of our bikes started falling apart. Literally falling apart. It was making creaking noises and then breaking down into pieces. It was held together by some ingenious straps and by removing all of his parts. The second was about 1 km from the beautiful city of Malmo, my right pedal fell off. The miraculous reason: I had screwed it in wrong when I had received my bike a week before the trip. It was my assembly error that drove my bike over the edge and broke it. So, for the rest of the 1 kilometer, I tried pedalling but couldn't; instead, I was pulled and pushed on the road until we reached the centre of the city where I quickly replaced my pedal at a bike shop for quite cheap amount. 

It took us little more than 3 hours in the rain to look around the city of Malmo but we were tired and we were sick of it. So, when we did decide to pack home after taking a look at the Twisted Torso, the rain stopped. The rain stopped when we stood outside the train station at Malmo. We cursed and swore loudly before getting onto the expensive train. When I came home at around 7 in the evening with my bag, and lay down on the couch, I could feel the relief in my body and the happiness in warmth. It was a great trip and the end was extremely refreshing. I recounted the story to some the guys I live with before moving into my room. It was 10 when I fell unconscious after a long warm and awesome bath.

##Epilogue

It was one of the most adventurous and spontaneous things I'd done in my life. It was different and the cold did not help but I made some lasting friendships on that trip and had a lot of fun. But more than that, it taught me a lot of things. It taught me the value of spending a night in warmth and shelter. It showed me the value of 'fire'. In this day and age, we take fire for granted but those 2 nights when we kept searching for fire and then making our fire was by far the best thing. It was a tiring and exhausting day with frustrations all around but everything disappeared when we built that fire. I can imagine the same awe and happiness when early man discovered fire. More than that, those 3 days without electronics and the fun of being disconnected in the wild was perfect. It was happiness when I did it. If you are ever in Copenhagen and you find 3 days of time and some good weather; pack your bags and go. You won't regret it. Maybe take a map.
